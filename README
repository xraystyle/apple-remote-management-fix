Hey Mac SysAdmins! Are you tired of your pesky users disabling remote management for 
the admin account on the Macs you manage? Yeah, it got real old, real fast. Here's
the solution.

xraystyle's Remote Management Fix is a daemon controlled by launchtl that will automatically
re-enable Remote Management in System Preferences for the admin account you specify.

It also outputs to the local system log every time it fires off, so you can see how much work 
it's saved you.

Make sure you go through the scripts and change any instance of ADMINACCOUNT to the admin 
account name on your systems before building the package.

The Apple PackageMaker file should be ready to open and build once any tweaks have been made.

The assembled .pkg can then be run locally by the user, or deployed en masse via Apple Remote Desktop.
